                Jain cooking has long been regarded has difficult and limiting. Without the availability of many “staple” ingredients, how is one supposed to create delicious, tasty meals? How can one create wholesome meals with only beans and legumes? This cookbook hopes to debunk this belief and show the great potential for taste in Jain cooking.  We have compiled a number of traditional Indian recipes and international recipes that comply with Jain principles.  With the advent of new innovations in the culinary arts and the greater availability of more ingredients, we have been able to modify recipes to satisfy our tastes and our soul. No longer will you feel like you are missing out on certain cuisine because it is not Jain. No longer will you be at a lost as to how to cook for your Jain friends and family. From the comfort of your kitchen, you can now enjoy food that is nutritious, tasty, and Jain.
